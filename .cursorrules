# Cursor Rules for iamrossi Project

## Required Reading
**Before starting any task, you MUST read and follow the guidelines in:**
1. `AGENTS.md` - Coding standards, security practices, and development guidelines
2. `CLAUDE.md` - Project overview, architecture, tools, and operational constraints

These files contain critical information about:
- Code style and TypeScript practices
- Security requirements (authentication, validation, error handling)
- Testing requirements and safety guarantees
- Redis/data persistence patterns
- API route patterns
- Build and validation commands

## Critical Requirements
- **ALWAYS run `pnpm validate` before declaring any task complete**
- **ALL API endpoints handling sensitive data MUST require authentication**
- **Tests MUST use mocks or localhost Redis - never touch production data**
- **Follow all security guidelines in AGENTS.md**

## Quick Reference
- Validation: `pnpm validate` (runs type check, tests, lint, build)
- Testing: `pnpm test` (uses mocked Redis, safe for production)
- Type checking: `pnpm type:check`
- Linting: `pnpm lint`

Refer to AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md for complete guidelines.
